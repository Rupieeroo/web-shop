  Web Store Test
</h1>

A simple and responsive web store built as a tech test. This project has been built using React with Jest and Enzyme.

## :running: Development Journey

1.  **Creating a responsive React Web-app**

    After initialising the project with:
    ```sh
    create-react-app web-shop
    ```

    Create-react-app ships with jest and babel, so to complete my environment I added the enzyme testing library:
    ```sh
    yarn add enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 react-test-renderer
    ```
    I began by making the products test and component. As I wanted this project to be responsive, I created props for the products component to pass into the rendering, rather than rendering static jsx tags. I followed this format for each of the different clothing component sections and their testing counterparts.

    Once everything that was needed for the products component, I refactored the separate clothing components to be rendered in Products.

    Now that all the items were being rendered to the site my focus could be turned to completing the user stories.
